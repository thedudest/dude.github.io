	<h3 class="backcolor">The Different Types</h3>
		<p>There are three different types of wormholes, only two, so far, of the three are we able to pass through if they are made:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Einstain-rosen bridge theory
			<li>String theory
			<li>man-made theory
			</ul>
		<p>they all have not been achived yet, but scientists have been working towards that goal for longer the a centary. they
		wanted to explore the region of space, they wanted a faster way to travel, scientists have only found three theories,
		as mentioned before, they found out that wormholes could be real after the discovery of quantum physics, and the 10 
		dimansions plain. we will also mention some of the most important physicist that were studing quantum physics:</p>

			<ol>
			<li>Nathan Rosan
			<li>Albert Einstein
			<li>Niels Bohr
			</ol>
		<p>These people were the first to start this debate in the solvay confrence, 1927.</p>
