		<h2 class="backcolor">Extotic Matter</h2>
		<p>before discussing the man-made theory, we need to talk about exotic matter, this matter is different than any other matter, "You would need some very exotic type of matter in order to stabilize a wormhole, and it's not clear whether such matter exists in the universe." states Hsu. so far exotic matter can only be found in space vacuums, and this matter for a strange reason is negative, unlike most matter, like anti, dark, or normal matter it has a negative charge and repelles anything that gets close to it.</p>
