		<h1 class="backcolor">Wormholes and How They Work</h1>
		<a href="https://www.space.com/20881-wormholes.html"><img src="https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAyOC81MTAvb3JpZ2luYWwvc2h1dHRlcnN0b2NrXzI1MDE2MDM1LmpwZw=="></a>
		<h3 class="backcolor">The Different Types</h3>
		<p>There are three different types of wormholes, only two, so far, of the three are we able to pass through if they are made:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Einstain-rosen bridge theory
			<li>String theory
			<li>man-made theory
			</ul>
		<p>they all have not been achived yet, but scientists have been working towards that goal for longer the a centary. they
		wanted to explore the region of space, they wanted a faster way to travel, scientists have only found three theories,
		as mentioned before, they found out that wormholes could be real after the discovery of quantum physics, and the 10 
		dimansions plain. we will also mention some of the most important physicist that were studing quantum physics:</p>

			<ol>
			<li>Nathan Rosan
			<li>Albert Einstein
			<li>Niels Bohr
			</ol>
		<p>These people were the first to start this debate in the solvay confrence, 1927.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
		<h2 class="backcolor">Einstein-Rosen bridge</h2>
		<p>The Einstein-Rosan bridge theory was created by Albert Einstein, and Nathan Rosen. They met and discussed the matter of blackholes cennecting it with quantum physics, and with what they knew, after much descussion, they came upon this theory of a bridge between two parralel universe, they stated that the black hole would suck anything in but on the side a thoerised white hole, which is the opposite of a black hole, it spits things out, instead of pulling them in. this was probably the first or second theory for wormholes.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
		<h2 class="backcolor">String theory</h2>
		<p>The string theory, possibly the oldest theory for wormholes to ever excist, states:</p>
		<p>imagine, a cosmic string streched millions of light years, streched by the big bang, and each string has a entrance at each end of the line, these wormholes are very old, and they are just waiting for us.</p>
		<p>this theory probably makes the most sence out of all the other theories made so far, and scientists think there might even be one in the center of the milky way galaxy. </p>

		<h2 class="backcolor">Extotic Matter</h2>
		<p>before discussing the man-made theory, we need to talk about exotic matter, this matter is different than any other matter, "You would need some very exotic type of matter in order to stabilize a wormhole, and it's not clear whether such matter exists in the universe." states Hsu. so far exotic matter can only be found in space vacuums, and this matter for a strange reason is negative, unlike most matter, like anti, dark, or normal matter it has a negative charge and repelles anything that gets close to it.</p>

`		<h2 class="backcolor">Man-Made theory</h2>
		<p>Man-Made theory is the thoery that physicists are trying to get to, because if humans have wormholes and they can put one anywhere they want then we would be able to travel long distances, like say as far as pluto in, like, about ten seconds, wormholes would be the evalution of all of travel, but the catch is, if we put a wormhole in a place and put another in a different place, the wormholes would a decimal to the power of negative 33 that means a decimal point with 33 zeros behind, that is small, and the problem is, we need exotic matter and so far that is not real yet, so until then no wormhole.</p>
