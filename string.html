		<h2 class="backcolor">String theory</h2>
		<p>The string theory, possibly the oldest theory for wormholes to ever excist, states:</p>
		<p>imagine, a cosmic string streched millions of light years, streched by the big bang, and each string has a entrance at each end of the line, these wormholes are very old, and they are just waiting for us.</p>
		<p>this theory probably makes the most sence out of all the other theories made so far, and scientists think there might even be one in the center of the milky way galaxy. </p>
