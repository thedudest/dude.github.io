		<h2 class="backcolor">Einstein-Rosen bridge</h2>
		<p>The Einstein-Rosan bridge theory was created by Albert Einstein, and Nathan Rosen. They met and discussed the matter of blackholes cennecting it with quantum physics, and with what they knew, after much descussion, they came upon this theory of a bridge between two parralel universe, they stated that the black hole would suck anything in but on the side a thoerised white hole, which is the opposite of a black hole, it spits things out, instead of pulling them in. this was probably the first or second theory for wormholes.</p>
